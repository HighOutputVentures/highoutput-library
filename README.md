# Highoutput Library
All modules under this repository will be published into `npm` under the `highoutput` account. The name of each module should be prefixed with `highoutput-`, e.g. `highoutput-utilities`. Each module should be placed under a folder with a name equal to the name of the module without the prefix, e.g. `utilities`.
